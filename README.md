Betting website client written with React.js, Redux, Redux Thunk, Immutable.js and React Router Dom.

I have decided to use React JS for the front end, because it fast and reliable and works very well with real time data

To run the application:

1. Run the provided mock API.
1. Go to the root folder of the client application and open config.js
2. Replace the host property in the cofiguration with your desired host.
3. Open the terminal and in it navigate to the project root folder.
4. Write 'npm start' in the terminal to run the application.
5. The application is now running on localhost:3000
