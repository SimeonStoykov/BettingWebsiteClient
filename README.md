Betting website client written with React.js, Redux, Redux Thunk, Immutable.js and React Router Dom.

I have decided to use React JS for the front end, because it fast and reliable and works very well with real time data

To run the application:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project. Run the `docker-compose up` command.
2. Go to the root folder of the client application and open config.js.
3. Replace the host property in the cofiguration with your desired host (the host used by docker).
4. Open the terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project. Run the `npm start` command.
5. The application is now running on localhost:3000.
